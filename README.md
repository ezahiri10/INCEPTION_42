# Inception Project | 1337 (42 Network)

## Project Overview
The **Inception Project** is a hands-on exercise in deploying a multi-service architecture using **Docker** and **microservices**. This project aims to strengthen understanding of containerization, service orchestration, networking, and DevOps workflows.

In this project, several services are set up to simulate a small production environment, including:

- **Nginx**: Web server and reverse proxy  
- **MySQL**: Database service  
- **PHPMyAdmin**: Database management  
- **WordPress**: Example web application  
- **Redis & FTP (optional)**: Supporting services  

This project provides practical experience with building, configuring, and connecting multiple containers to work together as a cohesive system.
